Sample project using [a maven package](https://github.com/sombriks/simple-java-run-cmd)
provided on maven central.

Unlike [the previous experiment](https://github.com/sombriks/using-sample-maven-package),
there is no need to spacial settings.xml in order to consume the package from a
custom nexus.
